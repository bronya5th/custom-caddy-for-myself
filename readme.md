This repository serves as a record of my study on creating a custom Docker image for Caddy with some **NON-STANDARD** modules. It uses GitHub Action's CI/CD process for building image.

## **NON-STANDARD** module lists

1. *nginx-adapter*
2. *ratelimit*
3. *cloudflare*
4. *realip*
5. *caddy-geo-ip*
6. *caddy-docker-proxy*
7. *caddy-cloudflare-ip*
